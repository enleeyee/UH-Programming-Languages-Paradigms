synopsis: We are awesome

details:

We are awesome, we can write a lot of code very quickly. 

But, once we do, we will pause, smile, and delete, and then take one small step so we can see how that first step feels.

1. A nice little canary test
2. A nice little test to tease out one line of DSL

Not to show we can write a lot of bad code quickly, but we are wise to take the time to incrementally develop and entertain the thought that we could actually create fluent code by slowing down and iterating a few times on the first step.
