(iteration:)
Use one of the languages you used for assignment 2.

Save the source file with proper extension and provide a build file to run the code. Don't write any tests, only code for this question. Follow language conventions.

Write a function that will take a list of numbers as parameter and return the sum of squares of the numbers.

Write the function using iteration but honor immutability.

Call the function a few times, with each of the following arguments:
empty list []
list of values [1]
list of values [1, 2]
list of values [1, 2, 4, 7]

Total[10]: 10
