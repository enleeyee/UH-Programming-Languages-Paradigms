What are some of the main differences between statements and expressions? What are the consequences of prefering one over the other?

The main difference between statements and expressions is the fact that expressions evaluate to a value. This value can be ‘None’, 5, Boolean anything that a language declares as a value. Statements do not evaluate anything, they just perform actions/side effects.
If expressions are overused they can greatly increase the complexity of the code and introduce and make it very hard to read and understand. This can happen because expressions don’t have a clear beginning and end and can be combined indefinitely, losing the expressibility that expressions give if properly used.

On the other hand, if statements are overused they can have side effects that you are not aware of, especially if using a global state and not having a proper check of state flow. Because you can swap expressions that take part in a statement, it is easier to write syntactically correct code that does not perform as intended.

In the end, a balance is needed, and use each for what it is best, since they both bring great advantages but it is important to keep in mind the consequences.
